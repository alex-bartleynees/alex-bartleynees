      <h2>Classes:</h2>
      <p> Classes are an attribute that we use in our HTML and CSS which allow us to apply
        different kinds of styles on differeet elements in our HTML. For example, we could use the class name
        "bright" to group several different html elements and then select this class in our CSS to style them the same way. 
 
      </p>
     
        <p>  Example of div and h1 element with class "bright" applied:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/classbright.png">
      <p>
        We could then style these classes in our CSS. In CSS we can select classes using "." then the class name.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/brightcss.png">

      <p>We can also add multiple classes to an element by just putting a space between the names of the classes. Here is an example of an h1 element with two classes applied.</p>

      <p>Classes are ideal to use when we need to apply the same style to more than one element.</p>

    
      <h2>Ids:</h2>
      <p> Ids are used when want to target a specific element with a unique Id. You cannot use the
        same Id with more than one element and the id must have a unique name that cannot be reused. Here is an example of an h2 element with an id selector added.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/idexample.png">

      <p>We would then select this in our CSS file with the "#" symbol and we can apply a unique style to our element. </p>

      <p>We can also add a class and an Id to the same element if needed.</p>

      <h2>Summary:</h2>
      <p>Classes are used when we need to target multiple elements and apply the same style. We can add classes to as many elements as we need.</p>
      <p>Ids are used when we need to target an element and add a unique style and should not be used more than once in an HTML document. For example, in our HTML there should only be one element with a unique id, we can't reuse that id with the same element further down the page.</p>
      <p>It's important to remember that classes and ids have no meaning by themselves in the HTML document, it's up to us to define and style them in our HTML and CSS documents.</p>
