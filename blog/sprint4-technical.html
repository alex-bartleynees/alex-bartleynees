                <h2>When I got blocked on a simple problem:</h2>


                <p>
                    A time I was blocked on a simple problem was during this week's challenges when we had to remove a
                    word “buzz” from an array. The problem was that the word had different capitalisation throughout the
                    sentence and I was stuck on how to get the word “buzz” to match when it had different letters
                    capitalised. I started off attempting to solve it by trying different methods and ways of solving it
                    but none of them worked. I ended up googling and thought the toLowerCase method could work but I
                    couldn’t figure out how to apply it to all the words in the sentence. The problem was I didn’t
                    really understand how the arrow function within the filter method was working. I had an ‘aha’ moment
                    when I realised I could add the toLowerCase method to the argument being passed into the function. I
                    learnt that I have a tendency to jump right in and try to start writing code without thinking enough
                    about the problem first and planning how I will solve it.
                </p>

                <h2>When I solved a problem in an elegant way:</h2>

                <p>
                    I think the times I have solved a problem in an elegant way are when I have taken the time to really
                    think about and understand the problem first and taken the time to write some pseudocode and
                    understand the steps I need to take to reach a solution. This week I think I solved the problem
                    where we had to remove odd numbers elegantly because I had a better understanding of how the filter
                    method worked and I took the time to think about how to apply it. I also think going through each
                    line of code slowly and explaining to myself what each line is doing helped a lot. I learnt that
                    taking the time to think about the problem and plan how to solve it as well as understanding the
                    different methods I can use to help solve the problem really helps to end up with an elegant
                    solution rather than simply diving right in.
                </p>

                <h2>Problem Solving Techniques:</h2>

                <p>
                    Currently my most used problem solving method is just trying something through trial and error which
                    I think can be a bit hit and miss. I have also used console.logging a lot which I have found really
                    helpful to help find out where I am going wrong and what I need to do to fix the problem. I have
                    also used googling a alot which can be very helpful but the hard part is applying the information you’ve found to help solve
                    your problem. I also feel confident with the rubber ducky method, going slowly through each line of
                    code and really making sure I know what each line is doing.
