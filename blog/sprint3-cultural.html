        <h2>What is emotional intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is all about how we understand and process our emotions and feelings and how we relate to others. We might think about it as the left brain vs right brain. The left brain understands the world through language, concepts and logic which is what we generally think of as IQ. The right brain understands the world through intuition, emotion, feelings and imagination. These have more to do with emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence involves a collection of skills that we can develop, it’s not something that we either have or not, it’s something that everyone can cultivate. Daniel Goleman was the author or one of the first books about emotional intelligence and he described five components that make up emotional intelligence. These are self-awareness, the ability to understand our emotions and motivations and how they affect others. Self-regulation, the ability to control our moods and to think before acting, for example, if we’re feeling angry we wouldn’t just lash out at others but understand how we could redirect our anger in a useful and positive way. Social skills, these involve how we connect with others and manage our relationships. The final two are empathy, thinking about and considering other peoples emotions and motivation, how we understand what motivates and drives us to do what we do. </p>

        <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is different from IQ because it focuses on understanding our emotions and how we relate to others. IQ measures our analytical and logical thinking skills as well as our language skills and mathematical ability. We could have a very high IQ but have little understanding of our emotions, how to express them and how to relate to others and vice versa. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

        <p>Emotional intelligence is important because we don’t just live in a bubble by ourselves but because we are constantly interacting with others. Understanding our emotions, how we express them and how we relate to others has huge benefits in all areas of our life because it helps us to understand and get on well with our work colleagues, friends, family and loved ones. Emotional intelligence leads to excellent performance in the workplace because we understand our motivation and what drives us, we develop self-confidence and the ability to take initiative. We become a good leader because we understand how we relate to and influence and empathise with others. Cultivating emotional intelligence can also bring us more happiness because we have a better understanding of ourselves, how to process negative emotions and our values and what drives us in life. </p>
