                <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core
                    learning?</h2>

                    <p>I think that my ego often tries to discourage me. Often at the start of a challenge, I would feel
                        overwhelmed and feel like I wouldn’t be able to do it. Then I would surprise myself during the
                        challenge. I think that this is something I need to be aware of and to step up to challenges and
                        say
                        yes to them rather than not attempting something because I feel like I won’t be able to do it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also learned that I can often feel frustrated when I can’t figure something out straight away.
                        I
                        think I am not that great at delayed gratification, I want to figure something out as quickly as
                        possible and get the buzz from that. However, the times I really got stuck but kept with it and
                        eventually solved the problem felt really amazing with a great sense of achievement. </p>
                    <p>
                        My ego also often doesn’t like to self reflect! I have often felt a lot of resistance to
                        self-reflection and thinking about what I’m good at and what I need to improve upon. I think it
                        is
                        really hard to be 100% honest with yourself but I am going to keep trying because I think it is
                        a
                        really important skill.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>

                    <p>I think self-awareness is really, really important in learning so we can reflect critically on
                        what we are doing and see what patterns we are getting stuck in, what we are doing well and what
                        we can improve upon. Empathy is important so we can be kind and friendly to ourselves as well as
                        others when we are learning. Programming is hard and can often be frustrating so when we are
                        feeling stuck it is really important to be kind to ourselves and I think when we can be kind to
                        ourselves we will also be kind to others. I think values are important because they really help
                        give us a sense of meaning and purpose in life that is not dependent on our work or family. We
                        really need to know why we are doing the things we do and what sort of values we want to
                        contribute to the world to hopefully make the world a better place. </p>

                    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>

                    <p>What has surprised me the most is how helpful all the core learning practices are in learning how
                        to be a more effective learner. I especially found the self-reflection to be helpful in figuring
                        out what I am doing well and what I need to improve upon.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
                    </h3>

                    <p>I found genuine and honest self-reflection to be one of the most challenging parts! I feel like
                        my ego often wants to try and present a perfect version of me and is resistant to reflecting on
                        my flaws and what I need to improve.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning
                        in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>

                    <p>Because our emotions and feelings and what we think affects so much of what we do and how we
                        behave in the world. It’s really important to be able to understand ourselves and our emotions
                        and have a sense of purpose and meaning in life and this helps us to learn and work much more
                        effectively.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
                        just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>

                    <p>No, it definitely hasn’t felt like a waste of time! I feel like the core learning program and
                        especially self-reflection will help me to be a much better learner and a better person in life!
