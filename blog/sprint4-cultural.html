                <h2>Neuroplasticity:</h2>
                <p>Everything we do affects and changes our brain including what we think. Mental practice can be just
                    as effective as physical practice when we are starting to learn a new skill. We are not fixed and
                    static in what we can and can’t do but we can learn anything if we put the practice and effort in.
                    Our limitations are simply patterns of thought that we have ingrained into ourselves over the years.
                    With effort we can change these patterns of thought and neural pathways and learn new skills we
                    might have previously thought we wouldn’t be able to. </p>

                <p>I would engage with these principles by challenging my thoughts when I think I cannot do or learn
                    something. I would remind myself that our brains are always changing and there is no reason why I
                    can’t learn something new.
                </p>

                <p>I think a great way to increase nueroplasticity is meditation, this is because meditation helps us to
                    be more aware of our thoughts and feelings and we can notice how our patterns of thoughts and
                    emotions are limiting us and preventing us from achieving what we want. These thoughts can then be
                    challenged and we can try new things we might not have tried before. Meditation helps us develop a
                    new relationship with our thoughts were we realise we do not always have to believe what they are
                    telling us. </p>

                <h2>Growth Mindset:</h2>

                <p>Growth mindset is when we are facing a challenge that we respond to it with with a sense of
                    excitement and persistence. This is because with a growth mindset we view ourselves as easily able
                    to change and learn and that we can develop our abilities and skills. This is opposed to a fixed
                    growth mindset were we think we are born with the skills we have and this cannot be changed. For
                    example, thinking I was bad at maths at highschool therefore I will always be bad at maths
                    demonstrates a fixed mindset.
                </p>

                <p>I think what surprises me is just how much our thoughts and how we view ourselves and the world
                    affect what we do and our outcomes in life. Learning about the growth mindset feels really inspiring
                    and I want to challenge myself to learn new skills. </p>

                <p>I will integrate it by being aware of my thoughts and how I am responding to challenges and
                    difficulites. When I am finding something hard I will challenge myself to use it to learn and grow
                    rather than retreat away from it and feel like I’ll never be able to do it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These understandings may shape my learning plan by viewing it that is something evolving and
                    changing rather than set in stone. As I learn and grow I might become more aware of different areas
                    I want to focus on. I also might discover new strengths and challenges I need to work with. I think it will be important to make sure that I'm not getting stuck
                    in familiar habits but challenge myself to grow and learn new things.
