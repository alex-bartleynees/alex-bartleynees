                <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan:</h2>

                <p>
                    I would like to find work as a web or software developer. I have really been enjoying javascript and
                    the logic and problem solving that it involves so I feel more drawn to the back-end programming
                    rather than website design. I want to use the skills I learn to make a positive impact in the world.
                    
                </p>
                <p>I think my biggest strengths in Bootcamp will be my determination and patience. I am proud of
                    myself during foundations for keeping at it even when I felt stuck and frustrated and for
                    managing my time well. I feel like my determination means I will keep learning as much as
                    possible and never give up because it feels too hard and that I will give Bootcamp
                    everything I can. I think my limitations will involve self-confidence and not feeling good
                    enough. I’m looking forward to pushing myself and I think I will grow at lot during
                    Bootcamp.
                    
                </p>

                <p>
                    I think my biggest non-technical challenge will be speaking in front of a group and giving
                    presentations. I can be quite a quiet and shy person but I’m looking forward to challenging myself
                    and
                    rethinking my definitions of what I’m not good at.


                </p>

                <p>
                    I would like to develop more self-confidence and better communication skills. I would like to
                    develop more leadership skills as I think this is an area I lack in, I can sometimes feel shy to put
                    my ideas forward in a group and would like to challenge this.

                </p>

                <p>
                    My expectations from the Bootcamp team are that we’ll have a safe, fun learning environment but that
                    we’ll also be pushed to work hard and develop ourselves and put our best self out there.


                </p>
                <p>
                    My expectations of myself on Bootcamp are that I’ll do my best to work as hard as possible and put a
                    lot of effort in while keeping a positive attitude. I will do my best to embody the ideal of “joyful
                    effort”. If I feel like I am struggling I will seek help from the facilitators and teachers and make
                    sure to take care of myself by being kind to myself. I will do my best to work safely with others by
                    being empathic and caring and trying to see things from other peoples points of view.
                </p>

                <h2>Foundations Learning Plan:</h2>

                <p> My long term goal is to find work as a web or software developer and to continue learning
                    and
                    growing as much as I can.

                    My strengths are my determination, patience and passion for learning. When I want to learn
                    something
                    I always put a lot of effort in and I have a great ability to focus thanks to my meditation
                    practice. My limitations are that I often want to try and do everything for myself and
                    figure things
                    out on my own which can make it hard for me to ask for help when I need it.

                    I would like to develop my communication skills and confidence in myself and my abilities. I
                    have a
                    tendency to be quiet and can be shy to express my opinions so I would like to develop skills
                    to be
                    better able to express myself when needed.

                    I will manage my workload by staying focused and breaking down what I want to achieve into
                    manageable chunks. I will work productively and safely with others by being calm,
                    respectful, kind
                    and generous. I will take the time to listen to others and make an effort to communicate in
                    a clear,
                    effective manner. When things are building up and starting to get to me I will let others
                    know how I
                    am feeling and take time to meditate, do yoga and look after myself.

                    I will commit to seeking help when needed through reaching out to facilitators and my peers.
                    I will
                    make sure to seek help when I need it and before I feel completely overwhelmed. I expect the
                    facilitation team to be kind, generous and emphatic and available to listen and help.

                    I will ensure I make time every morning for my daily meditation.
