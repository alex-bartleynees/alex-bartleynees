            <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
            <p> My long term goal is to find work as a web or software developer and to continue learning and growing as much as I can. 

                My strengths are my determination, patience and passion for learning. When I want to learn something  I always put a lot of effort in and I have a great ability to focus thanks to my meditation practice. My limitations are that I often want to try and do everything for myself and figure things out on my own which can make it hard for me to ask for help when I need it.
                
                I would like to develop my communication skills and confidence in myself and my abilities. I have a tendency to be quiet and can be shy to express my opinions so I would like to develop skills to be better able to express myself when needed. 
                
                I will manage my workload by staying focused and breaking down what I want to achieve into manageable chunks. I will work productively and safely with others by being calm, respectful, kind and generous. I will take the time to listen to others and make an effort to communicate in a clear, effective manner. When things are building up and starting to get to me I will let others know how I am feeling and take time to meditate, do yoga and look after myself. 
                
                I will commit to seeking help when needed through reaching out to facilitators and my peers. I will make sure to seek help when I need it and before I feel completely overwhelmed. I expect the facilitation team to be kind, generous and emphatic and available to listen and help. 
                
                I will ensure I make time every morning for my daily meditation.
