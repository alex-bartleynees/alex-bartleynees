            <p>An ethical decision I have made was the decision to adopt a vegan diet. This was for a variety of reasons but one of the main values involved in the decision was the value of non-harming. Non-harming or ahimsa in Sanskirt is a primary value in Buddhism and I would consider it a central part of my Buddhist practice. It is acceptable to eat meat in Buddhism, and many Buddhist do, but some of the greatest Buddhist yogis were strong advocates of vegetarianism. The values I weighed up in this decision involved the value of non-harm as opposed to valuing pleasure and hedonism. To be honest, I really loved cheese and found it really hard to give that up, much harder than giving up meat! Other values involved in this decision were wanting to do something to help the environment because modern industrial dairying is quite harmful to the environment. I also consider dedication and diligence important values and being vegan can require quite a bit of this as there can often be many temptations to eat dairy. For example, sometimes going out to a restaurant there might not be many or any good vegan options so it can be very tempting to eat some meat or cheese. It requires some diligence to remind myself of why I went vegan in the first place and why I should stick to it. Generosity is also an important value for me that factors into my decision to be vegan. There are many different ways we can be generous, for example by giving material things to others or by giving our time. We can also be generous to ourselves. I view being vegan as being generous to the planet and the earth, non-human beings and to myself. It is being generous to the earth because modern industrial farming is quite harmful to the environment, and it is being generous to the animals that we normally eat. I also feel that it is generous to myself because I feel like eating a plant-based diet is very good for my body and suits me well, it makes me feel really good. The consequences of this action are that I’m doing something to help the environment and other animals rather than exploit them. I think most of the consequences have been positive because it is good for me and the environment. Luckily, my friends and family have been very supportive and I haven’t met anyone who has been offended by my decision to be vegan. Another important value of mine is being considerate to others so I’ve never tried to convert other people to being vegan. I think it’s important for people to do what they feel is best for themselves and their body.

            <p>I think that a lot of my values have been influenced by my family and especially my mother while I was growing up. My mother really instilled in me an appreciation for the value of family and community and that we need to look after and cherish our loved ones. Growing up by the sea I think helped foster an appreciation for the environment and the fact that it is something we need to cherish and look after rather than just take from. My values have also been strongly influenced by my Buddhist practice. I have always felt strongly attracted towards spirituality since I was a teenager and admiring people who had strong values of compassion and kindness. I seriously started practising Buddhism and meditation four years ago when I had a personal crisis and felt like my mind was out of control, I realised I needed a spiritual practise and started practising yoga and meditation. Meditating daily has helped instil a strong sense of discipline, patience and kindness. The six paramitas are values which we actively try to cultivate in Buddhism and they include generosity, discipline, patience, joyful effort, concentration and wisdom. I think it is easy to think about which values we want to cultivate but the hard part is actually living up to these values. I feel that meditation helps me to develop and live up to these values and hopefully share the joy and happiness I get from these values out into the world. Buddhism has also had a strong impact on my identity, I have really felt inspired and look up to Buddhist monks and yogis who really embody integrity and compassion. In Buddhism, the enlightened masculine represents compassion and skilful action and I have found that trying to cultivate more compassion has made me a much stronger person. I think sometimes in our culture compassion can be looked down upon as weak but actually, it is a lot harder to be compassionate than it is to be angry and I find there is a huge amount of strength in compassion. </p>

            <p>I think a lot of my strengths in terms of learning and career development have come from my determination, diligence, patience, dedication and passion. In my previous career, I was a brewer and I was mostly self-taught. I started off homebrewing and became obsessed with it and taught myself by listening to podcasts and reading books and a lot of trial and error. I think my patience and determination helped me to keep learning and going with it even when a few early batches didn’t turn out so well. I ended up winning two gold medals at the National homebrewing competition which made me decide to pursue a career in the industry. These strengths also helped me a lot when I went back to university to study philosophy. Philosophy requires a lot of disciplined, creative and analytical thinking as well as patience as often you need a lot of time to think deeply about ideas before you come up with an idea of what your argument on the issue might be. I also think that my personal integrity and honesty has helped a lot in my career development. It’s really important to me to do what I say I am going to do and to be as honest as possible and I think that this is something that other people really appreciate. 

            I think largely my limitations have stemmed from my self-doubt and being too self-critical. My main “demon” is not feeling worthy or not feeling like I’m good enough and I think this has caused me to sometimes be scared of expressing my opinions and thinking that my ideas and thoughts might not be worth expressing. I think this also makes it hard for me to ask for help which has impacted my learning, I often feel like I need to do everything by myself and figure things out on my own even when I feel like I’m struggling or overwhelmed. I think this is something I will need to be really aware of and work on improving.

            <p>I think my main strengths which will help me in my learning journey are my determination, patience and passion. I feel really determined to learn as much as I can and I feel that my patience will help me to keep going when things are feeling like they are too hard or I am feeling overwhelmed. I’m also really passionate about learning and what I am doing which I think will help a lot. The idea of joyful effort is really important to me, we should work really hard and try to do the best we can while at the same time taking joy in our learning and maintaining a positive attitude. I think patience and self-awareness will really help a lot with my learning obstacles as well. When I am feeling like I don’t have much to offer or feeling unworthy I think just being aware of this and being patient with myself will help a lot.

            <p>An example of when I was trying to work productively with others but there was tension was in my previous job as a brewer where I was training an assistant brewer who was older than me and I think there was a bit of tension there from that. I think they felt that they should be learning or advancing more quickly than I was teaching. The strategies I used were trying to empathise but I also think I withdrew a bit and was afraid to really voice my opinion and feelings. I think I also found it hard to ask for help when I was finding it hard teaching someone else because it was my first experience doing this as well. I think it was good trying to understand their point of view but I think it would have been more helpful if I communicated better what they needed to learn and what my expectations were. I have a tendency to shy away from conflict and I think that I should have tried to communicate better because then they would have been more aware of my expectations and what they needed to learn to progress.
